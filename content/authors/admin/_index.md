# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include urban ecology, management strategies and plant ecophysiology. During my career I had the opportunity to work in different anthropogenically influenced ecosystems, i.e. managed heathlands, wetlands in proximity to urban development and agricultural landscapes. I am interested in the impact of human development and involvement on natural systems, their diversity and their physiology.

I am a post doctoral associate at the University of Florida in Dr Diane Rowlands lab. My research interests include urban ecology, management strategies and plant ecophysiology. During my career I had the opportunity to work in different anthropogenically influenced ecosystems, i.e. managed heathlands, wetlands in proximity to urban development and agricultural landscapes. I am interested in the impact of human development and involvement on natural systems, their diversity and their physiology.
